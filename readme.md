### "Bootstrap for Native"

Ionic is a front-end framework for Apache Cordova. Cordova  is a 'web view' wrapper that allows HTML5/Javascript applications to be deployed as "Hybrid" apps (act like native apps but are web technologies wrapped in a 'browswer shell'). Ionic provides a set of UI tools to Cordova, making hybrid development more similar to working with a full featured native SDK. While Cordova supports IOS, Android and Windows Phone, Ionic only. Ionic's CSS is designed to be easy to customize. Ionic relies on Angular for Interactions, Navigations & History, and Animations. It takes advantage of features like data binding and custom directives that Angular provides. Ionic's UI components are made available as Angular directives for easy integration.
